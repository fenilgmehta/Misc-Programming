## Tips
- It is highly suggested to do Competitive Programming in group so that everyone is motivated to continue even after small failures.
- One should try to solve problems which are slightly above their capacity but not too hard so that he/she does not get demotivated. Secondly, beginers should try to think of solution for 15-30 minutes, and:
    * If one is able to solve the question, then too they should see the tutorial for the question to see other peoples approach and also view the solution of those people whose code got accepted and took the least amount of time and memory.
    * If one is not able to solve the question, then see the tutorial/solution as beginners have a lot to learn and the brain won't get an idea to implement a new data structure required to solve the problem. And, one should understand the concepts required for the question throughly so that he/she is able to solve similar questions in future.
- Lastly, continue practicing question because if one stops problem solving for just a month, even then the confidence goes down. So, regularly solve question and praticipate in competitions to be confident of your skills.
